		<p>Like all types of dementia, Alzheimer's is caused by brain cell death. It is a neurodegenerative disease, which means there is progressive brain cell death that happens over a course of time. The total brain size shrinks with Alzheimer's - the tissue has progressively fewer nerve cells and connections.</p><br/>
		<p>While they cannot be seen or tested in the living brain affected by Alzheimer's disease, postmortem/autopsy will always show tiny inclusions in the nerve tissue, called plaques and tangles.<p><br/>
		<ul>
		<li>Plaques are found between the dying cells in the brain - from the build-up of a protein called beta-amyloid (you may hear the term "amyloid plaques").</li>
		<li>The tangles are within the brain neurons - from a disintegration of another protein, called tau.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<br/>
		<p>The abnormal protein clumps, inclusions, in the brain tissue are always present with the disease, but there could be another underlying process that is actually causing the Alzheimer's - scientists are not yet sure.</p><br/>
		<p>This sort of change in brain nerves is also witnessed in other disorders,3 and researchers want to find out more than just that there are protein abnormalities - they also want to know how these develop so that a cure or prevention might be discovered.</p>

		<p>Researchers do not fully understand why the changes that lead to Alzheimer's disease occur. Several different factors are believed to be involved. Risk factors for developing the condition include aging, a family history of Alzheimer's, and carrying certain genes.</p><br/>
